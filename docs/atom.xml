&lt;p&gt;Hey there! I recently decided to throw up a new website, the old one has been up for quite a while and it was time for a change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actual real motivation behind this though was because I wanted a place to share more about interesting projects I am working on. As any software engineer would do before starting a new big project&amp;hellip; prepare to start the new project by doing a smaller project that &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;needs&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; to be done first, in clear &lt;a href="https://xkcd.com/1739/"&gt;yak shaving&lt;/a&gt; fashion. So here we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to publish more updates on my learnings and progress with small devlogs that document the journey. There isn&amp;rsquo;t really a general cadence for how often I will write, but whenever I figure out something I was stuck on or discover something interesting, I&amp;rsquo;ll share it here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will post more updates with I am planning to build soon. Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry></feed>
