### Welcome to my new Website

Hey there! I recently decided to throw up a new website, the old one has been up for quite a while and it was time for a change.

The actual real motivation behind this though was because I wanted a place to share more about interesting projects I am working on. As any software engineer would do before starting a new big project... prepare to start the new project by doing a smaller project that _"needs"_ to be done first, in clear [yak shaving](https://xkcd.com/1739/) fashion. So here we are.

I'm hoping to publish more updates on my learnings and progress with small devlogs that document the journey. There isn't really a general cadence for how often I will write, but whenever I figure out something I was stuck on or discover something interesting, I'll share it here.

I will post more updates with I am planning to build soon. Stay tuned!
